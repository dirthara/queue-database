# Dirthara QueueDatabase

Database queue driver for the Dirthara framework. This repository is the initial package scaffold; no public API or release is available yet. Usage
documentation lives in [`docs`](docs/intro.md) and is published on the Dirthara documentation site at
<https://dirthara.github.io/docs/>, which documents every package in the framework.

## Installation

Requires PHP `^8.5` (PHP 8.5 or a later PHP 8 release), the `pdo` extension,
[`dirthara/queue`](https://github.com/dirthara/queue) `^0.1`, and
[`dirthara/database`](https://github.com/dirthara/database) `^0.1`, which
Composer installs for you. Each database also needs its own PDO extension
(`pdo_mysql`, `pdo_pgsql`, `pdo_sqlite`, or `pdo_sqlsrv`). Install with:

```sh
composer require dirthara/queue-database
```

## Docker development environment

Requires Docker with Docker Compose. The development image provides PHP 8.5 CLI, Composer 2.10.3, Mago 1.47.3, Xdebug,
and a PDO driver for every database the package supports: `pdo_sqlite`, `pdo_mysql`, `pdo_pgsql`, and `pdo_sqlsrv`.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dirthara/queue-database.git
cd queue-database
LOCAL_UID=$(id -u) LOCAL_GID=$(id -g) docker compose up -d --build php
docker compose exec php composer install
```

The container runs as the non-root `developer` user. The build arguments `LOCAL_UID` and `LOCAL_GID` default to 1000;
the command above uses your host IDs so generated files remain editable. Set `PHP_VERSION` to override the default
8.5 image. Rebuild when the Dockerfile or build arguments change.

`docker compose up -d php` also starts PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server and waits until each reports healthy, because
the tests run against every driver the package supports. The first start pulls roughly a gigabyte of images, and SQL
Server takes around thirty seconds to accept connections. The SQL Server image is published for amd64 only, so its tests
skip on an arm64 host.

Open a shell or stop the environment with:

```sh
docker compose exec php bash
docker compose down
```

## Tests

```sh
docker compose exec php composer test
```

Tests belong in `tests`, under `Dirthara\QueueDatabase\Tests`. Source belongs in `src`, under `Dirthara\QueueDatabase`.

Behaviour that needs a real database belongs in `tests/Integration`, where one conformance suite runs against every
driver. SQLite runs in memory and always runs; the PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server suites skip when their PDO driver
is missing, and read their connection from `DIRTHARA_POSTGRES_*`, `DIRTHARA_MYSQL_*`, and `DIRTHARA_SQLSRV_*`
(`_HOST`, `_PORT`, `_DATABASE`, `_USERNAME`, `_PASSWORD`), defaulting to the services in `compose.yaml`.

The package starts with its exception interface, `Dirthara\QueueDatabase\Exception\QueueDatabaseException`, and the
`HasExceptionContext` trait every exception uses to carry its context, both covered by tests.

## Code quality

Run the same checks as CI:

```sh
docker compose exec php composer ci
```

Run individual checks:

```sh
docker compose exec php composer fmt-check
docker compose exec php composer lint
docker compose exec php composer analyze
docker compose exec php composer guard
```

`composer mago` runs the formatting, import-order, lint, analysis, and configured architecture checks. `composer ci`
also runs tooling tests, unit tests, and the coverage gate.

Apply formatting and import sorting with `composer fmt`, or include automatic lint fixes with `composer cs`:

```sh
docker compose exec php composer fmt
docker compose exec php composer cs
```

`composer cs` includes potentially unsafe lint fixes; review its changes.

Run coverage separately with:

```sh
docker compose exec php composer test-coverage
docker compose exec php composer coverage
```

Xdebug is inactive by default and enabled for the coverage run. The report is written to `build/coverage/clover.xml`.
The gate requires 100% line coverage of `src` and lists uncovered lines.
